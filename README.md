# Popsicle!
A **modified version of System76's Pop!_OS** with custom kernel, `gnome-software` as `dpkg` and `flatpak` frontend and some other improvements focused on gamers. **Full list of changes in the Wiki**.

**NEW!** You can now also convert an existing installation of *Pop!_OS* into *Popsicle!* by running the shell script provided at ***Releases***.

I recommend checking Xanmod's official website to install a kernel that is further optimized for your particular CPU microcode at https://xanmod.org after installation. The repo already comes with *Popsicle!*, so you will only have to `sudo apt install` the version corresponding to your CPU.

Current version available: **22.04-3** | kernel 6.9.5-linux-xanmod-x64v1 on ***Releases***
