# Popsicle!
A **modified version of System76's PopOS** with **Gnome Software as its package manager frontend**, **Linux-XanMod kernel** for better performance and up-to-date features, **Timeshift** to create and manage system snapshots for recovery, and minor tweaks like having **Wayland enabled by default** for multimonitor setup support out of the box, and `linux-xanmod` kernel and `moe.launcher` for *Anime Games Launcher* repos added for a seamless experience installing and updating those.

I recommend checking Xanmod's official website to install a kernel that is further optimized for your particular CPU microcode at https://xanmod.org after installation. The repo already comes with Popsicle!, so you will only have to `sudo apt install` the version corresponding to your CPU.

Current version available: **22.04-1** | kernel 6.9.5-linux-xanmod-x64v1 on ***Releases***
